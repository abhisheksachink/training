        <h1>The Gautam Buddha (563/480-483/400 BC)</h1>
        <div id="div1">
        <p>
            Siddharta Gautama, who is usually referred to as "Buddha," 
            was the  philosophical monk who founded the Buddhist religion
             from meditation, which led him to "enlightenment" and 
             knowledge about how to help living beings and reduce 
             suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although many believers deny that it can be considered
             as such, Buddhism is one of the most important 
             religions in the world, with more than 500 million
              followers worldwide (approximately 8% of the world
               population).
        </p>
        <h3>What is Buddhism?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>This ancient religion ranks fourth on the list of most
             popular faiths</strong> in the world after Christianity, Islam, 
             and Hinduism. It's estimated that there are between 488 
             and 535 million Buddhists around the world, or, 
             approximately 8% of the global population.

                        Birth
                        <p>Siddhartha Gautama is born in Lumbini, near the 
                            Nepalese-Indian border to his father, King Suddhodana, 
                            ruler of the Sakya tribe, and his mother, Queen Mayadevi. 
                            The father gives his son the name of Siddhartha (the one 
                            who obtains success and prosperity), his second name is 
                            Gautama (name of the clan).</p>

                        Marriage
                        <p>
                            According to legend, he married at the age of 16 and had 
                            a son soon thereafter, but Siddhartha's life of worldly 
                            seclusion continued for another 13 years. He married his
                             beautiful cousin Princess Yasodhara, who is of equal age.

                        Renunciation (gives up his life as a prince)
                        <p>In the night of his 29th birthday, Siddhartha gives up his
                             life as a prince and secretly leaves the court while 
                             everyone is asleep. He travels far and crosses the river 
                             Anoma, where he shaves his hair and hands over his princely 
                             garments to his groom Channa, with instructions to return 
                             them to the palace.</p>

                        Leaves the palace (Four sights)
                        <p>Despite of the amenities of life, Siddhartha is not satisfied
                             with the mere enjoyment of fleeting pleasures due 
                             to his inquiring and contemplative nature. One day, he 
                             leaves the palace for an excursion and there he encounters
                              what so far has been purposely veiled from him.</p>

                    <li>
                        Discovery of the Middle Way
                        <p>After experiencing the extremes, he found that self 
                            denial was a s unsatisfactory as life in the palace 
                            is, so he came to the conclusion that the best course
                             was the Middle Way, or a path between both extremes. 
                             The best life was one of moderation.</p>

                        Enlightenment
                        <p>While meditating under a Bodhi tree in Bodh-Gaya, 
                            south of Gaya in the state of Bihar, India, the Bodhisattva 
                            experiences the Great Enlightenment, which reveals to him 
                            the way of salvation from suffering. He spends seven weeks 
                            meditating in the vicinity of the site of the Bodhi tree and 
                            attains the status of a fully realised Buddha at the age 
                            of 35.</p>

                        Death
                        <p>
                            Having achieved the goal of spreading the teaching to the 
                            greatest number of people, Buddha dies at the age of eighty 
                            years, as a result of food poisoning. He dies in a forest 
                            near Kusinagara, Nepal, in the company of his followers 
                            reclining on a bed where he speaks his last words: "All
                             compounded things are ephemeral; work diligently on your
                              salvation." With these words on his lips, he passes into 
                              the state of Nirvana.
